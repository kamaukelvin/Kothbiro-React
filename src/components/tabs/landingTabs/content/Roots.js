      <p>
        Auma be uwinja, koth biro kel uru dhok e dala (Do you hear me, Auma.
        Bring home the cattle for the rains are coming) are the words of Ayub
        Ogada and Mbarak Achieng’s 1980’s hit song Koth Biro that gained
        prominence locally and abroad.
      </p>
      <p>
        The song’s title would later find solace in unfamiliar fields of soccer
        although with the help of weather patterns. What started as matches
        between young schoolboys, playing for different clubs in the mid 1970s
        in Ziwani estate, later became the biggest offseason tournament in
        Nairobi held mostly during the short rains season in December.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were cases of national team players sneaking out of camp just for
        a chance to play for their clubs in Koth Biro, a tournament that also
        provided an avenue for young boys to display their talents.
